Zed Shaw text base game for learing python the hard way

Start by saving the game in a directory you can find in either power shell or visio as adventure.py

You have to copy the text out of my adventure.py file on to your pc and play with it there then add to the adventure.py file here

My gole is to apply information from Zed Shaw Learn Python The Hard way

Kind of like testing the person if they seen the video or read the book im looking for clever ways to incorprate the class in to the different rooms

such as the number_room if you answer anything other then 127 you will get a game over 

however the only way to get te right answer is to define both hens = 25 + 30 / 6 and rooster = 100 - 25 * 3 % 4 then telling python chickens = hens + roosters

and getting the right answer to type in the game 

if the users gives a number answer less then or more then 127 they get a game over and told to go visit excersize 3
